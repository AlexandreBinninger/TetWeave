<h2 align="center" id="introduction"> Introduction</h2>

This is the codebase for our work **TetWeave: Isosurface Extraction using On-The-Fly Delaunay Tetrahedral Grids for Gradient-Based Mesh Optimization**, accepted as Journal paper at SIGGRAPH 2025.

### Environment

Our code has been tested with CUDA 12.4. Prior to running the code, it is advised to create a virtual environment. You can simply do so with conda via the following commands:

```bash
conda create --name TetWeave python=3.10
conda activate TetWeave
pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio==2.5.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
pip install torch_scatter imageio tetgen trimesh tqdm scikit-learn omegaconf transformers gdown polyscope ninja pymeshlab numpy==1.26.4
pip install "git+https://github.com/NVlabs/nvdiffrast/" "git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d.git" kaolin==0.17.0 -f https://nvidia-kaolin.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/torch-2.5.1_cu124.html
```

If you are met with numpy version incompatibilities, these are probably due to Tetgen and can be fixed via the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy==1.26.4 --force-reinstall
```

### Evaluation dataset (~2.0GB)

After creating the environment, you can download our dataset by running

```bash
python download_evaluation_dataset.py
```

This will download our [preprocessed dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e_W2qbtrmV3bxohJhJcqYQJzeGngRXG0/view?usp=sharing), unzip it, and place it in [./assets/data/](./assets/data/).

After installing the environment, you can verify that it's working properly by typing

```bash
python main.py
```

This script will launch the optimization procedure using the [default config file](./assets/configs/default.yaml), which should take less than 4 minutes on a RTX 3090 GPU. Intermediate results will be saved in [./out/default/](./out/default/). More details can be found below.

### Shape representation

Our shape representation is particularly simple: it simply consists of a point cloud with a sdf and (optionally) spherical harmonics coefficients. Examples of our representation can be found in the [examples](./assets/examples/) folder. Mesh can be reconstructed and visualized by launching the corresponding script:

```bash
python visualize.py --model_path [MODEL_PATH.pt]
```

`--model_path` or `-mp` takes `"./assets/examples/crab_compressed.pt"` as default argument, and will save the reconstructed mesh to `[MODEL_PATH].obj`.

The shape reconstruction happens in `tetweave.py`, where the main functions are registered in the class `TetWeave`. The reconstruction happens in `__call__`. It takes the point cloud positions, the sdf, and the spherical harmonics coefficients and degree as input. It then builds a Delaunay tetrahedral grid via Tetgen, and uses Marching Tetrahedra to reconstruct a mesh. If spherical harmonics are used, our implementation of Marching Tets incorporates the computation of the directional signed distance.

### Optimization

This pipeline corresponds to the sections 4 and 5 of our paper, where we assume that we can render a target shape from any angle without epistemic uncertainty. To launch the optimization, launch:

```bash
python main.py --config [config_file.yaml] --out_dir [OUT_DIR] --ref_mesh [mesh.obj]
```

#### Config files

Parameters of the optimization can be found the config file. Most importantly, the config file incorporates the following fields:
- `lr_sdf`, `lr_x_nx3`, and `lr_sh`: the learning rates for the SDF values, the point positions, and the spherical harmonics coefficients.
- `accumulation_delaunay`: the number of steps before two updates of the Tetrahedral grid. Setting this value to 1 will update the Delaunay triangulation at every step, which makes the optimization takes longer. Default value is 5.
- main stage and late stage's `iter`: the number of iterations for each stage.
- main stage and late stage's `loss`: the different loss weights used during optimization. Because during the late stage, the grid is not updated, there is no ODT loss. We also do not use the fairness loss in this stage neither.
- `resampling.aggregation`:
- `resampling.sampling_method`:
- `resampling.voxel_resolution`:
- `resampling.steps`: will tell at which iteration
- `spherical_harmonics`: whether to use spherical harmonics, and with which degree. 

Other fields are either explained, or should be self-explanatory. We provide config files for point clouds ranging from 8K to 128K grid points, with the resampling steps that were used for our paper.
